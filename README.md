# zombiezen.com/go/log

This package is the concrete implementation of the design described in
[DESIGN.md][], formerly a proposal for the Go project.  While it was not
suitable for being an "official" package, I still wanted to use it for my own
projects.  If others find it helpful, then I'm happy.

This is not an official Google or Go project.
